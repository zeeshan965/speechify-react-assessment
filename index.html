                            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
                            typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                            industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                            scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                            survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                            into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                            unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                            release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
                            passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                            software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of

                            In mathematics, specifically category theory, a
                            functor is a mapping between categories. Functors
                            were first considered in algebraic topology, where
                            algebraic objects are associated to topological
                            spaces, and maps between these algebraic objects are
                            associated to continuous maps between spaces.

                            Javascript uses functors in the form of
                            Symbol.iterator. Most built-in objects have a
                            <code>[Symbol.iterator]</code> key which describes
                            how to iterate over the given object. You can learn
                            more about it on the incredible
                            <a href="https://javascript.info/iterable"
                                >javascript.info</a
                            >. This concept allows us to do iteration and by
                            extension, mapping (<code>.map()</code>,
                            <code>.filter()</code>, etc) on many different
                            objects from arrays to generators. The function we
                            provide to <code>map()</code> will be run on all the
                            iterable's values while maintaining the container's
                            generic type.
